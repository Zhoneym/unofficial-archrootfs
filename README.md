Arch Linux, a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.

Compared to the official Docker image repository, this repository has the following advantages:


 - Faster update frequency
 - A simpler and more transparent packaging method
 - High degree of freedom and customizability


We offer three options:


 - base: Minimal package set to define a basic Arch Linux installation
 - base-devel: Minimum package set to define a basic Arch Linux installation and basic tools to build Arch Linux packages
 - workstations: Contains commonly used compiler tools and common system management tools (this option is very suitable for working with Microsoft WSL2)
